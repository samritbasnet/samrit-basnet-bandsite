          <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
          <p>
            The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band
            consists of a dynamic lineup featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
            keyboardist, and a drummer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an
            unsigned act, drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive experience
            working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the band could
            succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well-known
            record label. From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and
            ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the
            band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and
            fastest up-and-coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as
            “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. The Bees
            Knees are currently recording their second studio album, looking to be released in early
            2024.
